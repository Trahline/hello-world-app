The first responder is meant to give status to a text field or where ever you are able to type teh first responder status. This means as long as the text field has this status the keyboard will pop up and it will accept text inout from the keyboard. With the input of resign first responder to a text field or other actions that accept text it will lose the first responder status and also lose the control of the keyboard and shake input from the phone and thus will also make the keyboard disappear. The keyboard will stay hidden until another action that can accept text recieves first responder status.
